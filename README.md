Healthcare Data Exploration

Problem Statement

The healthcare industry generates a vast amount of data, which, when analyzed properly, can provide meaningful insights into patient health, medical trends, and potential risk factors. The goal of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given healthcare dataset to uncover hidden patterns, detect anomalies, and visualize relationships among key attributes.

Objectives

Load and understand the dataset
Identify missing values and handle data quality issues
Generate summary statistics for numerical columns
Visualize data distributions using histograms and boxplots
Identify correlations among variables using a heatmap
Detect outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method

Dataset

The dataset, healthcare_data.csv, contains patient health records with features such as:
Age: Patientâ€™s age in years
Blood Pressure: Recorded blood pressure levels
Other clinical measurements (if applicable)

Implementation Steps

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Inspect the dataset using .info() and .head() to understand its structure.
Check for missing values using .isnull().sum() to identify data quality issues.
Generate summary statistics using .describe() for numerical insights.
Visualize distributions of features like Age and Blood Pressure using histograms and boxplots.
Analyze correlations among numerical variables using a heatmap.
Detect outliers using the IQR method to identify extreme values.

Technologies Used

Python (for data analysis and visualization)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)

Expected Outcome

Identification of missing values and outliers
Visualizations of key patterns in healthcare data
Summary statistics for better understanding of the dataset
Heatmap for correlation analysis

Conclusion

This project provides a foundational approach to analyzing healthcare data. The insights generated can help in decision-making for medical research, patient care, and hospital management.
